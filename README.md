# OmniCustomGym

Some custom implementations of Tasks and Gyms for [Omniverse Isaac Sim](https://docs.omniverse.nvidia.com/app_isaacsim/app_isaacsim.html), photo-realistic GPU accelerated simulatorfrom NVIDIA, based on
[Gymnasium](https://gymnasium.farama.org/), a maintained fork of OpenAIâ€™s [Gym ](https://github.com/openai/gym) library (no longer maintained). The aim of the package is to provide a standardized interface to loading Robots and their configuration from URDF and SRDF, loading and cloning them in Isaac Sim for RL applications.
