# OmniRoboGym

Some custom implementations of Tasks and Gyms for Robotics, based on [Omniverse Isaac Sim](https://docs.omniverse.nvidia.com/isaacsim/latest/index.html), a photo-realistic GPU accelerated simulator from NVIDIA, and on [Gymnasium](https://gymnasium.farama.org/), a maintained fork of OpenAIâ€™s [Gym ](https://github.com/openai/gym) library (which is no longer maintained). 

The aim of the package is to provide standardized interfaces for loading floating-base robots and their configuration from URDF and SRDF, cloning them in Isaac Sim and, in general, simplify simulation setup for RL-based Robotics. Additionally, multi-robot support is also available. 

If you're also interested in bridging CPU-based controllers with parallel simulations (potentially running on GPU) please have a look at [CoClusterBridge](https://github.com/AndrePatri/CoClusterBridge).

For usage examples, please have a look [here](https://github.com/AndrePatri/LRhcExamples).

The preferred way of using OmniRoboGym package is to employ the provided [mamba](https://mamba.readthedocs.io/en/latest/user_guide/mamba.html) environment. 

Installation instructions:
- First install Mamba by running ```curl -L -O "https://github.com/conda-forge/miniforge/releases/latest/download/Mambaforge-$(uname)-$(uname -m).sh"``` and then ```bash Mambaforge-$(uname)-$(uname -m).sh```.

- Create the mamba environment by running ```create_mamba_env.sh```. This will properly setup a Python 3.7 mamba environment named ```OmniRoboGym``` with (almost) all necessary dependencies

- Activate the environment with ```mamba activate OmniRoboGym```

- From the root folder install the package in editable mode with ```pip install -e .```.

- Test the Lunar Lander example from StableBaselines3 v2.0 with ```python OmniRoboGym/tests/test_lunar_lander_stable_bs3.py```.

- Download [Omniverse Launcer](https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/omniverse/download/), go to the "exchange" tab and install ``` Omniverse Cache``` and  ```Isaac Sim 2023.1.0```  (might take a while). You can then launch it from the Launcher GUI or by navigating to ```${HOME}/.local/share/ov/pkg/isaac_sim-2022.2.1``` and running the ```isaac-sim.sh``` script. When launching IsaacSim for the first time, compilation of ray tracing shaders will take place and may take a while. If the resources of the workstation/pc are limited (e.g. RAM < 16GB), the compilation may abort after a while. You can still manage to compile them by adding sufficient SWAP memory to the system. Before trying to recompile the shaders, remember however to first delete the cache at ```.cache/ov/Kit/*```.

- To be able to run any script with dependencies on Omniverse packages, it's necessary to first source ```${HOME}/.local/share/ov/pkg/isaac_sim-*/setup_conda_env.sh```.

OmniRoboGym uses URDF and SRDF xacro files to import and load the robot into IsaacSim. For an example on how to structure you urdf/srdf folders, have a look at [these](https://github.com/AndrePatri/LRhcExamples) examples.

External dependencies to be installed separately: 

- [Omniverse Isaac Sim](https://developer.nvidia.com/isaac-sim), photo-realistic GPU accelerated simulatorfrom NVIDIA.

Other dependencies included in the environment thorough Anaconda which can optionally be installed directly from source for development purposes: 
- [CoClusterBridge](https://github.com/AndrePatri/CoClusterBridge): utilities to create CPU-based control cluster to be interfaced with GPU-based simulators using shared memory for minimum latency.

The package is also available thorugh Anaconda at [omni_robo_gym](https://anaconda.org/andrepatri/omni_robo_gym).
