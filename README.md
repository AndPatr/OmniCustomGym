# OmniRoboGym

Wrapper on top of [Omniverse Isaac Sim](https://developer.nvidia.com/isaac-sim), a photo-realistic GPU accelerated simulator from NVIDIA.

The aim of the package is to a easy interface for loading floating-base robots and their configuration from URDF and SRDF into IsaacSim, cloning them with Isaac Sim API and, in general, simplify simulation setup for RL-based robotics applications.
